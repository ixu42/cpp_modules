Sed is for losers, or so they say.
But Sed is powerful in its own way.
In the world of text, Sed has its place,
A tool for many, saving time and space.

Losers may laugh, and mock this tool,
Yet Sed stands firm, reliable and cool.
With scripts so short, it does so much,
A simple command, a magical touch.

Those who call Sed for losers, they must see,
It's not the tool, but how you use it, that's the key.
For Sed, in skilled hands, transforms and cleans,
Turning text into treasure, with unseen means.

So here's to Sed, the unsung friend,
For every line of text it helps to mend.
Losers may scoff, but we will cheer,
For Sed is a champion, let's make that clear.
